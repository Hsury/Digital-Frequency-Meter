# Digital-Frequency-Meter
In this project, Arduino acts as an upper computer while FPGA acts as a lower computer.</br>
It means that FPGA constantly collects raw data of the input signal and sends it to Arduino using a simple communication protocol.Once Arduino receives the latest data, it will calculates and displays the information of the signal on an 128x64 OLED.
