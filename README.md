# Digital-Frequency-Meter
In this project, Arduino acts as an upper computer, while FPGA acts as a lower computer.</br>
FPGA constantly collects raw data of the input signal and sends it to Arduino using a simple communication protocol.</br>
Once Arduino receives the latest data completely, it will calculate and then display the information of the signal on an 128x64 OLED.
